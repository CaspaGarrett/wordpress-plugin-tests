DEPRECATED
==========
This way of setting up plugin unit tests is deprecated.

Use the [wp scaffold plugin-tests](http://wp-cli.org/blog/plugin-unit-tests.html) command from [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org) to create all the needed files automatically.

If you can't use WP-CLI, just copy the files from the [sample plugin](https://github.com/wp-cli/sample-plugin).
